In this section, I follow \citet[Chapter~5]{campbell2017financial} and discuss some 
of the conceptual building blocks for the strand of time-series empirical finance literature.

\subsection{Market Efficiency}
An intuitive way of explaining \textbf{\textit{market efficiency}} is that efficient markets
are competitive and allow no easy ways to make economic profit. A more useful and testable
definition was given by \citet[p.~127]{malkiel1989efficient}:

\begin{quote}
    The market is said to be efficient with respect to some information set $\phi$,
    if security prices would be unaffected by revealing that information to all participants.
\end{quote}

Some event studies taht measure market responses to news announcements can be interpreted
as tests of market efficiency regarding the announced information.
